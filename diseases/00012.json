Ce syndrome est très rare, il a été décrit dans moins de 20 familles comprenant plusieurs patients atteints à des générations successives. Les anomalies des extrémités intéressent le rayon radial et varient de l'hypoplasie de la phalange distale du pouce avec limitation de mobilité de l'articulation inter-phalangienne à l'hypoplasie sévère du pouce et à la polydactylie pré-axiale (duplication du pouce), parfois associée à une syndactylie des doigts. Les anomalies rénales vont de la malrotation à l'ectopie croisée avec fusion partielle sans vraie forme en fer à cheval ; on peut rencontrer d'autres anomalies de l'arbre urinaire telles que reflux vésico-urétéral et diverticules vésicaux. Les anomalies oculaires comprennent un colobome du nerf optique, un ptosis et/ou une anomalie de Duane (strabisme congénital caractérisé par une limitation du mouvement horizontal de l'oeil, une rétraction du globe et un rétrécissement de la fente palpébrale lors de l'adduction). Une surdité neuro-sensorielle a été décrite chez certains patients ; c'est pourquoi il a été proposé que le syndrome de Okihiro (anomalie de Duane associée à des anomalies du rayon radial et à une surdité) et le syndrome acro-oculo-renal pouvaient constituer une entité unique. Le syndrome acro-oculo-renal se transmet sur le mode autosomique dominant, et une mutation du gène SALL4 (gène identifié chez des patients avec une anomalie de Duane) a été retrouvée dans l'une des familles décrites. Le patient avait, outre l'anomalie de Duane et une atteinte du rayon des membres et des reins, une surdité neuro-sensorielle, ce qui évoque un syndrome de Okihiro.","name":"Acro-renal-ocular syndrome","parents":["Orphanet_330206"],"ancestors":["Orphanet_183533","Orphanet_330206","OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0019042","MONDO_0015161","EFO_0000508","MONDO_0019755","Orphanet_183530","MONDO_0000839"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_959","name":"Orphanet_959"}}}

Onset within the first two years of life with a delay in walking is not uncommon; however, onset may occur later. CMT1E is caused by point mutations in the PMP22 (17p12) gene. The disease severity depends on the particular PMP22 mutation, with some cases being very mild and even resembling hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies, while others having an earlier onset with a more severe phenotype (reminiscent of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome) than that seen in CMT1A, caused by gene duplication. These severe cases may also report deafness and much slower motor nerve conduction velocities compared to CMT1A patients.","name":"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E","parents":["Orphanet_65753","Orphanet_90642"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease - deafness","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-deafness syndrome","CMT1E","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-deafness","autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and deafness","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1E","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease demyelinating type 1E","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and deafness"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy and deafness, autosomal dominant","CMT 1E","Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1E","Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, demyelinating, type 1E"]},"ancestors":["Orphanet_98497","Orphanet_183500","OTAR_0000006","EFO_0009676","EFO_0005772","Orphanet_96210","MONDO_0002320","Orphanet_71859","EFO_0004238","MONDO_0024417","MONDO_0021945","MONDO_0000426","EFO_0000618","Orphanet_140453","MONDO_0000429","MONDO_0037940","Orphanet_140450","MONDO_0019755","EFO_1001455","EFO_0009387","OTAR_0000018","EFO_0002970","EFO_0003100","EFO_0003782","EFO_0009386","Orphanet_65753","Orphanet_90642","Orphanet_166","EFO_1001902","EFO_0004149","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_98505","MONDO_0000839","MONDO_0018776","Orphanet_183497"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000006","EFO_0000618","OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_90658","name":"Orphanet_90658"}}}
