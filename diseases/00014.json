People with ring chromosome 15 often have growth delays before and after birth, resulting in short stature; varying degrees of intellectual disability ; low muscle tone (hypotonia); craniofacial malformations; and limb abnormalities. Other symptoms might include congenital heart defects, kidney problems, congenital dislocation of the hips, and cafe-au-lait spots. Ring chromosome 15 is caused by an abnormal chromosome known as a ring chromosome 15 or r(15). A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places and the broken ends fuse together. The features of ring chromosome 15 appear to result from the loss (deletion) of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 15. Ring chromosome 15 is usually caused by spontaneous (de novo) errors very early in embryonic development. In rare cases, it is passed through families, either from a parent who also has a ring chromosome 15, or from a parent who has a balanced translocation. Treatment for ring chromosome 15 is focused on addressing the symptoms present in each individual and may require a team of medical specialists.","name":"Ring chromosome 15","parents":["Orphanet_363203","MONDO_0700091"],"synonyms":{"hasExactSynonym":["ring chromosome 15","Ring chromosome type 15"],"hasRelatedSynonym":["chromosome 15 ring","Ring chromosome 15 syndrome","R15","Ring 15"]},"ancestors":["OTAR_0000018","MONDO_0700091","Orphanet_363203","Orphanet_68335","Orphanet_98127","EFO_0000508","Orphanet_102020","MONDO_0019755","MONDO_0000839"],"descendants":[],"children":[],"therapeuticAreas":["OTAR_0000018"],"ontology":{"isTherapeuticArea":false,"leaf":true,"sources":{"url":"http://www.orpha.net/ORDO/Orphanet_96177","name":"Orphanet_96177"}}}

The disorders differ in terms of the distribution and extent of muscle weakness (some forms of MD also affect cardiac muscle), age of onset, rate of progression, and pattern of inheritance. The prognosis for people with MD varies according to the type and progression of the disorder. There is no specific treatment to stop or reverse any form of MD. Treatment is supportive and may include physical therapy, respiratory therapy, speech therapy, orthopedic appliances used for support, corrective orthopedic surgery, and medicationsincluding corticosteroids, anticonvulsants (seizure medications), immunosuppressants, and antibiotics.

These episodes can last from weeks to months, and the time between them, during which there are usually no symptoms, can vary from weeks to years.Most people with BRIC1have their first episode of cholestasisintheir teens or twenties. Symptoms oftenpresent with severe itchiness, followed by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) a few weeks later. BRIC1 is caused by mutations in the ATP8B1 gene. This condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.BRIC1generally does not cause lasting damage to the liver. However, in rare cases, episodes of liver dysfunction may develop into a more severe, permanent form of liver disease known as progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
